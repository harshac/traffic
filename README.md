# traffic
This project is a visualization of the min cost max flow algorithm.
The algorithm was tweaked to solve the traffic problems of the city.
To run the program, run the Application.java which will give you the current status between any 2 nodes with the following info
capacity:denotes the maximum load which the road can take
flow:current flow of the traffic on that road
signalTime : The signal time(stop signal) on that road
Terminologies:
Road=link
nodes=junctions

The visualizer is built using d3 javascript library.
Run the index.html to see visualizations of the traffic state.
